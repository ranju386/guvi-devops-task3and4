If your application is deployed on a cloud platform, ensure that the security group or network security settings allow inbound connections on port 9000.
Troubleshooting Application Deployment
Check Application Configuration:
Ensure that your application is correctly configured to listen on port 9000 and that the necessary services are running.
Network and DNS Configuration:

Verify that DNS settings are correct and that the network configuration allows traffic to reach your application server on port 9000.
By using these methods, you can determine whether port 9000 on guvi.com is open or not. If the port is closed or filtered, you may need to adjust firewall settings, network configurations, or troubleshoot your application deployment further.
